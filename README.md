# 📊 AI-Based Advertisement Performance Prediction

Predict how well an advertisement will perform—**before you run it**—using machine learning models trained on historical ad campaign data. This project uses advanced AI techniques to forecast metrics like **click-through rate (CTR)**, **conversion rate**, **engagement**, and **ROI**.

## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning pipeline that predicts the **effectiveness of online ads** based on various attributes such as:
- Ad copy (text)
- Visual/image metadata
- Target audience (age, location, device)
- Platform (Google, Facebook, Instagram)
- Timing, budget, and duration

The output includes:
- Predicted CTR or ROI
- High/low engagement label
- Explanations via feature importance

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Predicting **CTR** and **conversion rate** of ads before deployment
- Budget optimization for campaigns
- A/B testing simulation using models
- Auto-recommendation for best audience segments and creatives
